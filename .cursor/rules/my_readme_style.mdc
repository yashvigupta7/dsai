# README Formatting Preferences

## Headers

### Header Structure
- Use `#` for main title: `# README '/folder/filename'`
- Use `##` for main sections (Activities, Readings, etc.)
- Use `###` for subsections
- Maximum two heading levels (`##` and `###`)
- Include icons in section headers when appropriate: `## 🚀 Deployment`, `## 📚 Readings`

### Banner and Footer
- Start with banner image: `![Banner Image](relative/path/to/image.png)`
- End with footer image: `![Footer Image](relative/path/to/image.png)`
- Include "Back to Top" link in footer: `← 🏠 [Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)`

## Icons

### Icon Usage Guidelines
- **Use icons frequently** throughout the document for visual interest and clarity
- Common icon patterns:
  - 🚨 for critical/important sections
  - ✅ for completed items or checklists
  - ⚠️ for warnings or important notes
  - 📚 for documentation sections
  - 🔧 for technical/setup sections
  - 💡 for tips or insights
  - 🚀 for deployment or launch sections
  - 📋 for lists or checklists
- Add icons to section headers, list items, and key points
- Use icons to mark section headers: `## 🚀 Deployment`, `## 📚 Readings`

## Code Blocks

### Code Block Formatting
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting: ` ```r `, ` ```python `, ` ```bash `, ` ```markdown `
- Reference the actual file above or below code blocks
- Include comments in code to explain non-obvious steps
- Keep code examples practical and runnable
- Format file references near code blocks: `See [`filename.ext`](path/to/file.ext) for the implementation`

### Inline Code
- Use backticks for:
  - File names: `` `app.R` ``
  - Function names: `` `fetch_data()` ``
  - Commands: `` `npm install` ``
  - Code snippets: `` `const x = 1` ``

## Tone

### Writing Style
- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly; avoid unnecessary words
- **Humble**: Don't assume expertise; explain concepts clearly
- **Direct**: State facts directly without filler phrases

### Phrases to Avoid
Never use phrases like:
- "it is obvious"
- "it is critical"
- "clearly"
- "obviously"
- "as you can see"
- "it goes without saying"

### Instead Use
- Direct statements: "This step configures the API endpoint" (not "It is critical that you configure...")
- Factual descriptions: "This concept is used throughout the course" (not "It is obvious that...")

## File References

### Activity/Reading/Lab Files
- Use human-readable names (titles) as link text with appropriate prefixes
- Format: `[ACTIVITY: Human-Readable Title](ACTIVITY_filename.md)`
- Format: `[READ: Human-Readable Title](READ_filename.md)`
- Format: `[LAB: Human-Readable Title](LAB_filename.md)`
- Examples:
  - ✅ `[ACTIVITY: Run Ollama Locally](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)`
  - ✅ `[READ: Finding APIs](READ_find_apis.md)`
  - ✅ `[LAB: Build an AI-Powered Data Reporter](LAB_ai_reporter.md)`
  - ❌ ``[`ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md`](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)``
  - ❌ `[Run Ollama Locally](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)` (missing prefix)

### Code/Script Files
- Use filename in backticks as link text
- Format: ``[`filename.ext`](relative/path/to/file.ext)``
- Examples:
  - ✅ ``See [`functions.R`](functions.R) for helper functions``
  - ✅ ``[`app.R`](app.R) — Main Shiny application``
- Always include relative hyperlinks when discussing files

### File Reference Placement
- Reference files above or below code blocks
- Include brief descriptions after file links when helpful
- Use relative paths consistently

## Formatting

### Text Emphasis
- **Bold** (`**text**`) for:
  - Key terms
  - File names
  - Important concepts
  - Section labels
- *Italics* (`*text*`) for:
  - Subtle emphasis
  - Alternative phrasing
  - Course names or titles

### Lists
- Use numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for sequential steps
- Use bullet points (`-`) for informational items
- Use checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for actionable items
- Add icons to list items when they enhance clarity
- Indent sub-items with `-` for related files under activities

### Blockquotes
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for:
  - Brief topic descriptions after title
  - Important notes or callouts
  - Course descriptions

## Examples

### Good Header with Icon
```markdown
## 🚀 Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy your application...
```

### Good File Reference (Activity)
```markdown
1. [ACTIVITY: Run Ollama Locally](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)
   - [`01_ollama.sh`](01_ollama.sh) — Start Ollama server
```

### Good File Reference (Code)
```markdown
See the [`plumber.R`](plumber.R) file for the API implementation.
```

### Good Code Block with Reference
```markdown
See [`functions.R`](functions.R) for the implementation:

```r
fetch_data <- function(url) {
  # Implementation here
}
```
```

### Good Tone
```markdown
**Important**: Make sure to set your API key in the `.env` file before running the script.
```

### Avoid This Tone
```markdown
It is critical that you understand this concept, as it is obvious that...
```
