## ✅ Your Task

For this activity, each of you should have by now identified a project group.
It is each individual student’s responsibility to find a project group — although your instructor will help facilitate this process by generating potential starter groups. (See Canvas>>People>>TEAMS)

📝 Instructions
Please jot down the following:

1️⃣ **Who your team-mates are**
2️⃣ **Your project topic name**
3️⃣ **The API(s) you plan to use.**
4️⃣ **A brief description of your project concept**. What kind of AI-powered app do you want to make? (tentatively)

Please also confirm:

5️⃣ That you have **received access to this API**, and have already gotten any API keys necessary.

6️⃣ That you have checked **if this API is free or not**. If it is not free, you must be prepared to pay any fees (so free APIs are always encouraged, but not required).

📌 Important: You must have access to the API**now**.

## 📤 To Submit

**For credit**:  Each team-mate should submit this individually into the CANVAS textbox - response can be identical - to show that you are actively choosing this group.
