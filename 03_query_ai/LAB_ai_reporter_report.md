## Executive Summary
In 2024, the FDA reported a total of 1,000 medical device recalls, with significant activity concentrated in the latter half of the year. The dramatic increase in recalls, particularly during September and October, highlights critical issues in device manufacturing and compliance.

## Monthly Trends
1. **September Surge**: September recorded the highest number of recalls at 271, suggesting potential systemic issues or heightened scrutiny in manufacturing practices during this month.
2. **August Increase**: August saw a notable rise with 75 recalls, indicating a possible prelude to the fall trend or reactions to earlier quality control failures.
3. **Consistent Decline**: After peaking in September, recalls gradually declined, with December reporting 149 recalls, reflecting possible improvements in practices or seasonal production lags.

## Top 5 Root Causes
- Under Investigation by firm: **270**
- Process control: **188**
- Nonconforming Material/Component: **111**
- Device Design: **97**
- Process change control: **66**

## Recommendations
1. **Enhance Quality Control**: Improve process control measures to reduce recalls related to nonconforming materials and device design issues, particularly those identified as high-frequency root causes.
2. **Increased Transparency**: Establish systems for greater transparency during investigations to address recalls promptly, especially those classified as "Under Investigation."
3. **Invest in Staff Training**: Implement comprehensive training programs focusing on device design and process change control to minimize errors and improve overall product compliance.
