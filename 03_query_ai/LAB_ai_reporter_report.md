## Executive Summary

In 2024, the FDA reported a total of 1,000 medical device recalls, with significant fluctuations throughout the year. The most notable increases in recalls occurred in the latter half of the year, indicating potential underlying issues in quality control and compliance within the industry.

## Top Monthly Trends

1. **September Surge**: September experienced the highest recalls with 271, suggesting either heightened vigilance or systemic failures leading to safety concerns.
2. **August Rise**: August showed a notable spike with 75 recalls, potentially setting the stage for the September escalation in reported issues.
3. **Early Low Activity**: The months of January, February, April, and May combined accounted for only 43 recalls, indicating a stark contrast to later months, which may suggest a seasonal or regulatory trigger affecting recall rates.

## Top 5 Root Causes

- **Under Investigation by firm**: 270
- **Process control**: 188
- **Nonconforming Material/Component**: 111
- **Device Design**: 97
- **Process change control**: 66

## Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Quality Control Processes**: Given the high prevalence of recalls due to process control failures, manufacturers should enhance their quality assurance protocols to mitigate risks.
2. **Focus on Design Review**: With a notable number of recalls linked to device design (97 recalls), manufacturers should prioritize thorough design evaluations and user testing before market release.
3. **Implement Root Cause Analysis**: Establish a robust mechanism for identifying root causes of recalls, such as the high incidents of "Under Investigation" claims, to address issues proactively.
